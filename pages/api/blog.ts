Let me tell you a little bit about myself and how I started my travel journey and set my goal!</p><h2>The Beginning of My Journey</h2><p>Travel wasn't always a passion of mine. Growing up in a small town, international travel seemed like something only wealthy people could afford. That all changed during my junior year of college when I studied abroad in Spain.</p><h3>The Spark</h3><p>That semester in Madrid opened my eyes to how much there was to see and experience in the world. I realized that with careful planning and budgeting, travel was much more accessible than I had thought.</p><h3>Setting the Goal</h3><p>On my 22nd birthday, I made a resolution: visit 30 countries before turning 30. At the time, I had only been to 3 countries, so this seemed like an enormous challenge.</p><h3>The Strategy</h3><p>To make this goal achievable, I developed a strategy:</p><ul><li><strong>Budget ruthlessly:</strong> I tracked every expense and cut unnecessary spending</li><li><strong>Travel smart:</strong> I learned to find deals, travel during off-peak times, and use budget accommodations</li><li><strong>Maximize trips:</strong> I planned routes that allowed me to visit multiple countries in one journey</li><li><strong>Work remotely:</strong> I negotiated remote work arrangements to extend my travels</li></ul><h3>The Countries</h3><p>Over the next 8 years, I explored:</p><ul><li>Europe: Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, and more</li><li>Asia: Thailand, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia</li><li>Americas: Mexico, Canada, Colombia, Peru, Chile</li><li>Africa: Morocco, Egypt, South Africa</li><li>Oceania: Australia, New Zealand</li></ul><h3>Lessons Learned</h3><p>This journey taught me that travel is about more than just checking countries off a list. It's about personal growth, cultural understanding, and creating lasting memories.</p><p>If you have a travel goal, start planning today. The world is waiting for you!</p>"
